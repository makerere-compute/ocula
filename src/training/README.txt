DATA PREPROCESSING STEPS

removebadimages.py : Select any training images with badimage set in the annotation, and move both image and annotation to the badimages directory.

selecttestset.py : Randomly select some of the training files and move them to test-positive and test-negative directories (both image and annotation moved).

create_background_anno_files.py : Given a directory of background (negative) images without annotation XML, this script creates empty annotation files.

SURF/MOMENT/SIFT TRAINING STEPS

Step 1: features/extractfeatures.sh
Uncomment the lines corresponding to the features to use.

Step 2: trainfromfeatures.py
Select training type (Boosting/SVM) and features to use.

Step 3 (if Naive Bayes top level classifier to be used):
extractfeatures.sh (uncommenting feature_detectionoutput line)
trainfromdetectionoutput.py 

CASCADE TRAINING STEPS

Step 1: run preparetrainingimages.py
This script creates the info.dat file containing an index of object
bounding boxes in each of the training files. Optionally, extra negative
images can be generated by removing objects from the positive training
images. This needs to be run every time the training dataset changes.

Step 2: dotraining.sh
This script runs the OpenCV utilities createsamples and traincascade, to produce the final cascade.xml file used for detection.
